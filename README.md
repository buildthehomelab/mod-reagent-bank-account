# Reagent Bank Account

A reagent bank system for AzerothCore with a required WotLK 3.3.5a UI addon.

This module adds a server-backed reagent bank for trade goods, gems, and crafting materials. The addon provides the full player-facing interface: browsing stored reagents, depositing, withdrawing, profession prep, and Auction House shopping-list support.

## Profession Integration

Open a profession window and ReagentBankUI docks a reagent bank sidebar to its right edge.

- A craftable count for the selected recipe, counting bags and reagent bank together
- **Withdraw Needed** pulls missing reagents for the selected recipe
- A **Crafts** stepper for multi-craft amounts, with **x1**, **x100** and **Max** presets. **Max** fills in however many crafts your bags and reagent bank cover between them
- Per-reagent `+N` badges on the recipe's reagent rows showing what is waiting in the bank, green when bags plus bank cover the craft and orange when they do not
- A plan summary listing what to withdraw, what to buy, and which reagents are running low
- Optional leftover auto-deposit when closing the profession window
- **Add to AH List** adds missing recipe reagents to the shopping list
- Note that the UI icon is attached to the outside lower portion of the character frame by default.

## Auction House Shopping List

ReagentBankUI includes an AH shopping list for missing crafting materials.

You can add items to the AH list from:

- The main reagent item detail screen
- The profession window with **Add to AH List**
- The AH list **From Recipe** button
- Slash commands

Shopping list features:

- Edit item amounts directly in the AH list
- Right-click an item to change its amount
- Shift-right-click an item to remove it
- Left-click an item to search for it on the Auction House
- Print the list to chat
- Clear the list
- Shows needed amount and current bag count
- Compact AH helper panel opens beside the Auction House frame

Note: AH purchases do not automatically decrement the list. Adjust amounts manually from the list. I also have not tested this with any other AH addons.
